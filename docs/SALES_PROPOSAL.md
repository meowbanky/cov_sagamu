# ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## Q1: Do we need accounting knowledge to use this?
**A:** No! The system automatically creates journal entries. You just process member transactions (savings, loans, etc.) and the system does the accounting behind the scenes. Of course, having someone with basic accounting knowledge is helpful for understanding the reports.

## Q2: What if we want to change our chart of accounts?
**A:** Fully customizable! You can add, edit, or deactivate accounts anytime. We set you up with 90 standard accounts, but you can adjust to your needs.

## Q3: Can we import our existing data?
**A:** Yes! We provide free data migration from Excel, CSV, or your current system. Our team will help you.

## Q4: Is our data safe?
**A:** Absolutely! We use bank-level encryption, automated backups (daily), and secure servers. You can also keep a local backup. We comply with data protection regulations.

## Q5: What if we lose internet connection?
**A:** If cloud-hosted, you need internet to access. However, we can set up a local server (on-premise) for offline access. Or we offer a hybrid solution.

## Q6: Can we customize the software?
**A:** Yes! Logo, colors, cooperative name are free. Additional custom features are available in the Enterprise package or as add-ons.

## Q7: What if we have issues after go-live?
**A:** We provide support for 3-12 months (depending on package). After that, you can renew support annually or pay per incident.

## Q8: Do you offer training?
**A:** Yes! Training is included in all packages (1-5 days depending on package). We also provide video tutorials and manuals.

## Q9: How long to implement?
**A:** Typical implementation is 30 days from contract signing to go-live. Can be faster for smaller cooperatives.

## Q10: Can we try before buying?
**A:** Yes! We offer a free demo (2 hours) where we show you the system with your data. We can also set up a 14-day trial.

## Q11: What about regulatory compliance?

## Q12: Can multiple branches use the same system?

## Q14: What if we outgrow our package?
**A:** Easy upgrade! You can move from Starter → Professional → Enterprise anytime. We'll help with the transition.

## Q15: Is there a contract lock-in?
**A:** Annual subscriptions are standard, but we offer month-to-month after Year 1. No penalty for cancellation (though we doubt you'll want to leave! 😊).
